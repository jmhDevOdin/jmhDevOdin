- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmhDevOdin (Audacious choice, I know, but I love Norse Mythology!)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, hacking (ethically of course) and tinkering with electronics. Recently got into hardware programming (Simple stuff so far).
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a full time, fullstack software engineer with React/React-Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and AWS infrastructure. (Some background in C/C++, Python and JavaScript) and recently Rust with WebGL and Web Assembly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects on libraries, mobile apps, apis, hacks, scripts and mods. Also doing some small apps and games on the side hustle.
- 📫 How to reach me, Twitter, my github email, my portfolio site if it is work related.
