- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmhDevOdin
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, hacking (ethically of course) and tinkering with electronics. Recently got into hardware programming (Simple stuff so far).
- 🌱 I’m currently working with react/react-native, TypeScript and AWS tech stacks for work. (Some background in C/C++, Python and JavaScript)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects on libraries, mobile apps, apis, hacks and mods. Also doing some small apps and games on the side hustle.
- 📫 How to reach me, Twitter, my github email, my portfolio site if its work related.
