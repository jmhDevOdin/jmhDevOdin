- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmhDevOdin
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, hacking (ethically of course) and tinkering with electronics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react/react-native, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C and AWS tech stacks. (Some background in C/C++ and JavaScript/TypScript)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects on libraries, mobile apps, apis, hacks and mods. Also doing some small game dev on the side hustle.
- 📫 How to reach me, Twitter, my github email, my portfolio site if its work related.
